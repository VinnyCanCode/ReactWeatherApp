# Weather Dashboard

To continue diving into the learning process of React, I thought it would be great to recreate a weather dashboard. I had a new design in mind and a new api service that I created before. I found this project fun as my first "self-made" react project. Truly being able to see the power of React and how easy it was able to implement DOM changes that coincide with api calls. This was truly fun.
